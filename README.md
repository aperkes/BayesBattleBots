# BayesBattleBots
Simulation of the winner effect using Bayes Theorem

This repo contains all the code that accompanies the paper: Bayesian updating for self-assessment explains social dominance and winner-loser effects.

The directory bayesbots contains the structure of the simulation: 

fish.py defines the individual agents
fight.py governs the interaction rules for a single contest
tank.py holds groups of agents and runs the contests beetween them
params.py contains all of the parameters for everything

Each script in the parent directory creates a figure (more/less), and are useful examples of different standard uses of the model.

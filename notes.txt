Ran all the simulations, things are looking quite good. Ended with running Hock approach
One thing to keep in mind here is that "stability" measures fight performance, while "estimate" measures internal state. 
So when I'm plotting the est_history, I'm plotting their internal states, while stability is based on their wins/losses. 

In any case, it does seem like Hock is a lot less stable, but that could be in part just because of the inherent luck in the approach. 
The next thing to do in order for a fair comparison is to build hock-huber into my existing 'mathy' approach. 
This will allow me to control the role of luck, to compare apples to apples. It will even let me bring in skill, to fully explore the space. 

I'll also need to come up with the naive winner effects: a n-round boost to estimate, or simple jump in estimate (either additive, or a scale factor)
Once that's done, I can make some contrasting predictions on behavior. 

Keep in mind that Bayes should be the ideal solution to this problem, so the question is whether it is feasible, and whether it's 
actually that much better than a very simple heuristic. 

The other thing to think about is the likelihood function, since that could also be explored.
